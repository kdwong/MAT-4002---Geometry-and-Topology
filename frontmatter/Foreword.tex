This book is taken notes from the MAT4002 in spring semester, 2019. These lecture notes were taken and compiled in LATEX by Jie Wang, an undergraduate student in spring 2019. The tex writter would like to thank Prof. Daniel Wong and some students for their detailed and valuable comments and suggestions, which significantly improved the quality of this notebook. Students taking this course may use the notes as part of their reading and reference materials. This version of the lecture notes were revised and extended for many times, but may still contain many mistakes and typos, including English grammatical and spelling errors, in the notes. It would be greatly appreciated if those students, who will use the notes as their reading or reference material, tell any mistakes and typos to Jie Wang for improving this notebook.
